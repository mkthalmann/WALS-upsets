# Trying Out UpSet Plots With WALS

For this little project, I wanted to put upset plots to the test. To do that, I chose to work with word order patterns for various languages as collected in the [World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS)](https://wals.info). I am pretty pleased with the outcome and hope to get a change to work with upset-compliant data again in the future, so I am sharing the outcome here. Below is an example:

If you're interested in upset plots, I strongly encourage you to check out the (unfortunately no longer maintained) [UpSetR](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/UpSetR) repository here on Github.
